libtext-vimcolor-perl (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Be more careful about how 'exec' is called (belt & braces)

  * Improve error reporting.  Errors printed by the 'vim' command,
    as well as problems reported from 'exec' (like not being able
    to find the program) will now be reported (by getting passed
    through a temporary file).  Also, some 'die' calls were changed
    to 'croak'.

  * Allow the 'filetype' option to be overridden for each file
    processed, so that an object can be reused for multiple files
    of different types.

  * Provide a help/usage message in the text-vimcolor program.

  * Document which other CPAN modules use Text::VimColor, since
    you might find one of them be more useful than using it
    directly.

  * Various small corrections to the documentation.

libtext-vimcolor-perl (0.09-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow Vim options to be set with ':let' and provide a default
    option to make shell scripts be interpretted as Bash syntax,
    since it's a superset of Bourne shell.  Added corresponding
    options to 'text-vimcolor' script.

  * Added "+set nomodeline" option to Vim for belt-and-braces
    security.  Vim shouldn't read modelines with the default
    configuration enforced by the other options, but there's
    no harm being extra cautious.  Suggested by Ian Langworth.

  * If the 'vim' command fails, print the correct exit code in
    the error message.  Thanks to Smylers for the fix, and for
    reporting all the following bugs.
    (closes CPAN bug #11556).

  * Add documentation for the 'filetype' option to 'new()'.
    (closes CPAN bug #11558).

  * Document and test for using a reference to a scalar rather
    than just a plain scalar as the 'string' argument to 'new()'
    and the argument to 'syntax_mark_string()'.  It was already
    implemented but was mistakenly documented as a TODO.
    (closes CPAN bug #11557).

  * Document potential problem from CPAN bug #11555.

  * Tab characters weren't comming out right (you get "^I" instead
    of a literal tab).  Added ":set isprint+=9" to mark.vim to fix
    that.  Spotted and patched by Mario Xerri.

  * For some reason the filetype wasn't getting set right, so I've
    changed mark.vim to do ":filetype detect" when it wasn't already
    detected, and that seems to make it work.

  * The XML output sometimes produced an extra '>' after the start
    tag of the root element.  Fixed.

  * Added new file 05xml.t to the test suite and changed most of
    the tests to use Test::More instead of Test.

  * Now much faster!  By using the '-s' option when Vim is run, we
    avoid a 2 second delay while it tells us about the stdout not
    being connected to a terminal.  This only has an effect in Vim
    version 6.2 or later (behaviour changed in patch 6.1.191).

  * Fixed a bug reported by Giuseppe Maxia.  When Vim was run, it
    didn't do ":filetype on", so passing in a filetype explicitly
    didn't work.  It only worked if it could auto-detect the filetype.
    Added a test in 't/10cmp.t' which checks this, by using a string
    as input (so that there's no filename to guess the file type from).

libtext-vimcolor-perl (0.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The files which were in the 'shared' directory (XSLT and CSS
    stylesheets and the Vim script) are now in 'lib/Text/VimColor/'
    so that they get installed in a place the module can discover.
    Thanks to Giuseppe Maxia and Slaven Rezic for the tips.

  * Path::Class is now used (and is therefore a new dependency) to
    construct paths to files more portably.

  * Less confusing one-line description of text-vimcolor script.
  * Added the 'MANIFEST' file to itself, so that it gets shipped.
  * Distribute this ChangeLog (for my unofficial Debian package)
    rather than one generated out of CVS.
