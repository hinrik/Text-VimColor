libtext-vimcolor-perl (0.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The files which were in the 'shared' directory (XSLT and CSS
    stylesheets and the Vim script) are now in 'lib/Text/VimColor/'
    so that they get installed in a place the module can discover.
    Thanks to Giuseppe Maxia and Slaven Rezic for the tips.

  * Path::Class is now used (and is therefore a new dependency) to
    construct paths to files more portably.

  * Less confusing one-line description of text-vimcolor script.
  * Added the 'MANIFEST' file to itself, so that it gets shipped.
  * Distribute this ChangeLog (for my unofficial Debian package)
    rather than one generated out of CVS.
