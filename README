Text::VimColor
--------------

This module tries to markup text files according to their syntax.  It can
be used to produce web pages with pretty-printed colourful source code
samples.  It can produce output in the following formats:

The module comes with a command line program, text-vimcolor, which makes
it easy to do 'ad-hoc' syntax coloring jobs.


Installation
------------

This module mostly installs like any other.  The only tricky bit is
that it currently doesn't cleanly install the files in the 'shared'
directory.  By default it looks for these under /usr/share/text-vimcolor.
You'll need to copy them there by hand to have this module fully
installed and working.  If they need to go somewhere else instead,
alter the definition of the $SHARED variable in lib/Text/VimColor.pm

If anyone knows a way of doing this stuff automatically, let me know.
